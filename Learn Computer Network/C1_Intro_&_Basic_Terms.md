# What is Computer Networking?

    - It refers to "interconnected computing devices" that can "excahnge data" & "share resources" with each other.
    - These neteorked devices use a system of rules, called "Communication Protocol", to transmit information over "physical" or "wireless technology".

# BASIC TERMS

- ## CLIENT:

  - It is a computer "hardware device" or "software" that access "service" made available by "server".
- ## SERVER:

  - It is a "physical" computer "dedicated" to "run services" to serve the "needs" od other computers.
  - e.g., DB serve, Web server, file server etc.
- ## HOST:

  - Every computer connected to a network is a HOST, for which it provides DATA or Service over a network
- ## PEER:

  - A node with similar functionality as others, act as PEER to each other.
  - e.g., Laptop 1 <-talk-> Laptop 2 => both are peer to each other... but Human1 & Laptop1 is not peer.
- ## BANDWIDTH:

  - Measurement of MAX Data that can be transmit in a network connection over a given time, is BANDWIDTH
  - e.g., 20 MB/s of BandWidth
  - NOTE: speed - how much ACTUAL Data trasmitted in given time. e.g., speed 10 MB/s over bandwidth of 20 MB/s.
- ## PACKET:

  - Large DATA sent over computer network(e.g, INTERNET) is divied into small-small segment, these small Segment is called "PACKET".
  - e.g., Load an Image.
  - Image will come in small-small data packets, once all packets arrives, we can see the WHOLE image.
- ## What is PACKET HEADER?

  - It is a kind of "LABEL" to header, which provides 'information' about packet 'content', 'origin' & 'destinaiton'.
- ## JITTER:

  - In Internet, data packets sent in regular interval and takes set amount of time to transmit 1 complete Data.
  - During this, the "DELAY in sending" data packets over your network connection, is called "Internet/Network Jitter".
- ## Frame:

  - In networking, a frame is UNIT of DATA.
- ## LOCALHOST:

  -  when call an IP address, we try to connect to another computer on internet.
  But, when IP - 127.0.0.1, we try to connect to itself. "LOCALHOST" is "Your Own Computer".
  - Localhost is name of virtual server & also reserved Domain Name for testing & documentaion purpose.
- ## BIT RATE:

  - We communicate in binary(0's & 1's) over internet. 1 unit is called bits.
  - BIT RATE: no. of bits of data sent each second.
  - Bandwidth: max bit rate of system.
- ## LATENCY

  - time b/w sending of data msg & receiving of that msg, is "LATENCY".
  - e.g., My Computer sent msg to Google server in 0.30 ms. And Google receive msg after 0.40 ms. And my computer get ACKnowledgment from google that it received the msg.
  - total rount-trip LATENCY => 0.70 ms.
- ## Noise:

  - noise is any UNDESIRED signal in communication circuit.
  e.g., Cross talk, thermal noise, background ambience etc.
- ## ATTENUATION:

  - loss of signal strength in a connection.
- ## DISTORTION:

  - interruption of transmitting signals that cause an unclear reception.
