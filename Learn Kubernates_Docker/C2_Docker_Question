# Docker Question:

# Hypervisor?
    - A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization possible. It is also called Virtual Machine Monitor. 
    - It divides the host system and allocates the resources to each divided virtual environment.

# Docker image?
    - snapshot of complete application environment

# Docker Hub?
    - place where all Docker images live, registry.

# Docker Architectur?
    - Client => Rest API => server

# Dockerfile?
    - Instruction to package up application & its complete environment.

# LifeCycle of Docker Container:
    - Create a container
    - Run the container
    - Pause the container(optional)
    - Un-pause the container(optional)
    - Start the container

    - Destroy the container


# ADVANCE:

# Will you lose your data, when a docker container exists?
    - No, you wonâ€™t lose any data when Docker container exits. 

#  How far do Docker containers scale? Are there any requirements for the same?
    - Containers can be scaled to hundreds of thousands or even millions of them running in parallel.

# Can you remove a paused container from Docker?
    - NO, only stoped

# Can a container restart by itself?
    - NO

# How many containers can run per host?
    - Many

# Docker Repository ?

# EKS
    - elastic kuberates service
    - eks - start, run, and scale Kubernetes. 

# ECR
    - elastic Container registry
    - ECR, Easily store, share, and deploy your container.

# Scalability and Elasticity:
    - scalbility - adding resource
    - Elasticity - increare/decreasing resource dynamically as per traffic
