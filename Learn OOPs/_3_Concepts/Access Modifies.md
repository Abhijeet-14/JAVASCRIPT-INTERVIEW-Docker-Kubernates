# 4 access modifiers

* public
    - if method is public but class is not public then we can't access the method
* private
    - private can be accessed only inside its own class
* protected
  - it can be called in its package or at its subclass (someone inherit its class)
  - can't access outside package w/o inheriting
* default
    - it can access inside its package only
    - can't access outside package
# Note:
  - main class no need to declare class as _private or protected_, it doesn't make any sense.
  - but its inner class can be  _private or protected_
