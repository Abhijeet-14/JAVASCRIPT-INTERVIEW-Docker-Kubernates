# Finding Files & Directory
    - find [path...] [expression]
            :: recursively finds files in path that match expression
            :: find files in real time

    - '-name'  : find files by like name
    - '-iname' : like name, but ignore case
    - '-mtime' days : find files that are days old
    - '-size' num   : files of size num
    - '-newer' file : files newer than this file
    - '-type' file : files newer than this file
    e.g,
        - find . -name test.txt
        - find . -iname tEst.txt
        - find . -iname *tv
        - find . -iname *.txt
        - find . -mtime +10 -mtime -13 :: > 10 days old & < 13 days old
        - find . -size +1M :: file > 1Mb
        - find . -newer test.txt

    - 'locate' : list files that match patter
            - faster than find command
            - Queris an index
            - it didn't search in real-time :: new file won't be searched until its index created
        e.g., 
        - locate test.txt :: all files mathcing this pattern
        - locate test.t :: all files matching this pattern.. like test.txt
        

# Display files
    - cat file  : display file content of file
    - more file : Browse thro a text file
    - less file : more feature than more
    - head file : o/p beginning portion :: only first 10 lines
    - tail file : /p ending portion :: only last 10 lines

    e.g.,
        - tail -3 file :: display only last 3 lines
        - head -5 file :: display only first 5 lines

    - tail -f file :: view file in real time.. as its change 
        - e.g., log file, this will help in seeing new log content as its change

# Nano Editor
    - simple editor NOT powerful as VIM

# VIM:
    - powerful editor
    - it has 3 mode: command mode, insert mode, line mode
    - view file :: read-only file


# Deleting, Copying, Moving & Renaming files
    ## REMOVE
    - rm file       : remove file
    - rm -r dir     : remove dir and its content recursively
    - rm -f file    : force remove
    
    ## COPY
    - cp source_file dest_file
    - cp -i source_file dest_file :: do in INTERACTIVE mode
    - cp source_file1 source_file2 dest_dir
    - cp -r source_file1 source_file2 dest_dir :: if dest_dir  doesn't exist, it will create one.

    ## MOVE
    - mv :: MOVE or RENAME file or dir
    - mv SRC DEST
    - mv -i SRC DEST :: do in INTERACTIVE mode


# TAR: Collection of Files
    - tar c|x|t f tarfile [pattern]
        - c : create
        - x : extract
        - t : display list
        - v : verbose
        - z : compress
        - f : use this file

        e.g., 
            - tar cf test.tar *.txt :: create tar file with all .txt file
            - tar tf test.tar :: diplay content of test.tar
            - tar xf test.tar 
            - tar gzip compress files
    - gzip   :: compress
        - gzip test.txt
    - gunzip :: uncompress
        - gunzip test.txt.gz
    - gzcat  :: concatenate compressed file
    - zcat   :: concatenate compressed file
        - zcat test.txt.gz

    ## Disk Usage
    - du    : estimate file usage
    - du -k : display size KB
    - du -h : display in Human Readable format
