# Networking
    - TCP/IP
    - Classful networks
    - subnet masks
    - Broadcast address
    - CIDR
    - private address space

# TCP/IP
    - used for network communication
    
    - TCP - control data exchange
    - IP - send data from 1 device to another device
    - Hosts:
        - device on network that have IP add.

# IP networking
    - for a device to comm, we need:
        - IP add
            - 199.83.131.186
        - subnet mask
            - 255.255.255.0
        - broadcast add
            - 199.83.131.255

    - Network Add - what Ip host belong to & what IP data to deliverd

    - Host Add - specific device data should be deliver

# Classful Network:
    class         Network         Hostallowed
    - A         1.0 -> 127.0         16M
    - B         128.0 -> 191.255     65k
    - C         192.0 -> 233.255     255

# Subnet mast
    - A - 255.0.0.0       :: 1 network add & 3 host add
    - B - 255.255.0.0     :: 2 network add & 2 host add
    - C - 255.255.255.0   :: 3 network add & 1 host add
        e.g., 183.194.46.31
                => class B
                => network add '183.194'
                => host add '46.31'

# BroadCast Network
            Network       subnet          Broadcast
    - A     17.0.0.0     255.0.0.0       17.255.255.255
    - B   183.194.0.0    255.255.0.0     183.194.255.255
    - C   199.83.131.0   255.255.255.0   199.83.131.255


# CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
    - IP: 127.67.198.94
        - class A netowrk: 121.0.0.0
        - class A subnet: 255.0.0.0
        - class A broadCast: 121.255.255.255

    - this IP belong to class A, but CIDR can make it to any class 

    - IP: 127.67.198.94 subnet: 255.255.255.0
        - ip class A + subnet class C 
        - CIDR network: 127.67.198.0
        - CIDR subnet: 255.255.255.0
        - CIDR broadcast: 121.67.198.255
